# Self-Description Document: Software Bit Bang Communication Strategy

## I. Background and Purpose

In modern embedded systems, wireless communication is an essential technology. The PJON library offers a lightweight, interrupt-free hardware abstraction layer solution for high-speed, reliable, and cross-platform point-to-point communication. The Software Bit Bang (SBB) communication strategy is a key component of the PJON library, enabling data transmission over single-wire buses without using hardware timers or interrupts.

## II. Project Overview

### 2.1 Software Bit Bang Technology
The software bit bang technique involves simulating bit synchronization through programming. It uses functions like `digitalWriteFast()`, `micros()`, and `delayMicroseconds()` to precisely control timing, thereby achieving high-speed data transmission over single-wire buses.

### 2.2 PJON Library
PJON is an open-source project aimed at providing a cross-platform point-to-point communication solution. It supports various communication strategies, including hardware bit bang, software bit bang, SPI, and I2C. The Software Bit Bang strategy is a crucial part of the PJON library, suitable for resource-constrained single-wire buses.

### 2.3 Supported Platforms
This project supports multiple Arduino platforms such as Duemilanove, Uno, Nano, Leonardo, Micro, Mega, ATtiny85, and Arduino Zero. It also supports NodeMCU and other ESP8266 platforms.

## III. Main Features and Characteristics

### 3.1 High-Speed Data Transmission
The software bit bang strategy allows for high-speed data transmission over single-wire buses. Depending on the CPU frequency and communication mode, transfer speeds can reach up to 48,000 bps (bits/second).

### 3.2 Resource Efficiency
Since it does not depend on hardware timers or interrupts, the software bit bang strategy is suitable for resource-constrained single-wire buses, such as ATtiny85.

### 3.3 Reliability and Stability
Through precise control of timing, the software bit bang strategy ensures high reliability and stability. Even in resource-limited environments, it can guarantee accurate and complete data transmission.

## IV. Project Use Cases
